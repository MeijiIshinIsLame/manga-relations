That left Yokoyama, so I tried to do my homage to him in Akira. Specifically, I had the character Akira be the number 28 in the manga, which was a direct reference to the mecha Tetsujin 28-go. I also used numbers 25, 26 and 27 from that series too.

Akatsuka’s gags made me laugh so much that I would cry, and that’s when I learned the power of manga and just how fun it can be. The enemy characters' final lines in Fist of the North Star were inspired by him. They helped soften the blow of some of the more bloody, serious scenes.')">test</h1>
